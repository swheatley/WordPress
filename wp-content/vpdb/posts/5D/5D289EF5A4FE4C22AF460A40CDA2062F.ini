<h2>The Road Not Taken</h2>
<cite>Robert Frost</cite>


  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
  And sorry I could not travel both          (\\_/)
  And be one traveler, long I stood         (='.'=)
  And looked down one as far as I could     (\")_(\")
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;

  Then took the other, as just as fair,
  And having perhaps the better claim,          |\\_/|
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;       / @ @ \\
  Though as for that the passing there        ( > º < )
  Had worn them really about the same,         `>>x<<´
                                               /  O  \\
  And both that morning equally lay
  In leaves no step had trodden black.
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
  I doubted if I should ever come back.

  I shall be telling this with a sigh
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
  I took the one less traveled by,
  And that has made all the difference. 

 
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how it is handled and to find out how it overflows;
