post_content = "This is the post content. It should be displayed in place of the auto-generated excerpt in single-page views. Archive-index pages should display an auto-generated excerpt of this content. Depending on Theme-defined filters, the length of the auto-generated excerpt will vary from Theme-to-Theme. The default length for auto-generated excerpts is 55 words, so to test the excerpt auto-generation, this post must have more than 55 words.

Be sure to test the formatting of the auto-generated excerpt, to ensure that it doesn't create any layout problems. Also, ensure that any filters applied to the excerpt, such as &lt;code&gt;excerpt_length&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;excerpt_more&lt;/code&gt;, display properly."
